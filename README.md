# why?
I have lost new phone access and Authy doesn't decrypt on my old phone so i made this thing to rival with Authy. Not like there is anything to rival with on desktop as they killed their app there.

Before someone uses it without awareness - it stores encrypted data in script itself, it's a feature. And yes i am aware my data is there currently.
